# Extending and comparing methods for projecting social contact matrices

# Abstract

Contact matrices describe the degree of contact between individuals of given age groups. These matrices are commonly used to model how diseases such as COVID-19 spread in a population through social contact. There are pre-existing statistical methodologies to project empirical contact matrices to new countries. These projections have been demonstrated by Prem et al., and the resulting matrices have been extensively applied across infectious diseases applications. 

However, the social contact assumptions from Prem et al. do not match observations in many countries, and only provide outputs of the contact matrices for each country. This is limiting, as the age population distribution of many countries, including Australia, is quite heterogeneous, and assuming it is homogeneous would result in inaccurate representation of community infection in many regions.

In this talk we demonstrate new methods and free and open source software to compute synthetic contact matrices using population demographics, and present preliminary results comparing them with published methods.

# Bio

Nick Tierney has an undergraduate and honours in psychology, and a PhD in Statistics. He works as a research software engineer with Professor Nick Golding at the Telethon Kids Institute, based in Perth, Western Australia, but works remotely in Launceston, Tasmania. He works on improving and maintaining the greta (https://greta-stats.org/) R package for statistical modelling, and implementing workflows to automate analysis on diseases like COVID19 and malaria.

Nick was previously at Monash University (2017-2020), working as a research fellow, then lecturer, working with Di Cook in the NUMBAT group, and teaching ETC1010, introduction to Data Analysis.

Nick's research focusses on improving data analysis. This includes exploratory data analysis, statistical modelling, and diagnostics. He is a strong believer in free and open source software, and has written several R packages to improve data analysis, which can be seen on his software page (http://njtierney.com/software)
